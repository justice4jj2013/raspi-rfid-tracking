\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch:conclusion}

This chapter summarises the goals of this project and provides a description of its contributions. Then, section \ref{sec:future} gives ideas how to further develop and extend the location sensing system created in this project.

\section{Contribution}

The main aim of this project 

There are some general advantages of the system developed in this project. The software of the system was written in a modular way making it easy to change the localisation algorithm or wireless technology. For example, Bluetooth or WiFi devices can be used for location sensing. Furthermore, the system was developed with scalablility in mind, which means that more affordable computer nodes can be connected to the network to expand it.  

\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}

Rss battery factor adjusted during experiment to correct when a reader was misbehaving. Automate as future work
Future work: average the last 10 readings from readers to gain a better position
